## Create TodoList Components

We created the basic structure of the app and now let's move on to create UI for TodoList  component. We are going to divide the components into three parts

- TodoInsert.js
- TodoList.js
- TodoListItem.js

**TodoInsert** component is the one for TextInput and Add button which we are going to use to add todo items.

**TodoList** component will be using ScrollView to show todo items.

**TodoListItem** component will have states (completed or not) and events to be checked as completed or to be removed.

Let's create directory named components and add these three components in the folder.
