# The end
We've finally completed Multiple Counter example!

Personally, when I first learn Redux, I thought ' It's hard and so complicate thing and why i have to use Redux?'.

But given the experience of doing more complex projects than this simple example, I think Redux is one of the essential frameworks for state management.

Of course, there are several state management frameworks, such as Mobx, but we recommend that you try them according to your preferences as needed.

Thanks!
